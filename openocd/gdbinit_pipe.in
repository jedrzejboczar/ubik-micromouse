# assume that the binary has already been loaded

# start OpenOCD connecting to the remote target through a pipe
target remote | openocd -f @OPENOCD_CONNECT@ -f @OPENOCD_GDB@

# reset and stop execution

# upload binary

# ### SEMIHOSTING
#
# # monitor arm semihosting enable
#
# ### ITM DEBUGGING
#
# # send captured ITM to the file itm.fifo
# # (the microcontroller SWO pin must be connected to the programmer SWO pin)
# # 8000000 must match the core clock frequency
# monitor tpiu config internal /tmp/itm.fifo uart off 168000000
#
# # # OR: make the microcontroller SWO pin output compatible with UART (8N1)
# # # 2000000 is the frequency of the SWO pin
# # monitor tpiu config external uart off 8000000 2000000
#
# # enable ITM port 0
# monitor itm port 0 on


### INITIAL EXECUTION

# set breakpoint on main()
tbreak main

# continue until main()
continue
